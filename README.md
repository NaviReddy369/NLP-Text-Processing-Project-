NLP Text Processing Project üåê
A hands-on implementation of core Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts for text cleaning, analysis, and feature extraction. Perfect for learning fundamental NLP techniques and preprocessing workflows.

üìå Overview
This project demonstrates:

Text preprocessing for raw data (cleaning, normalization)

Statistical analysis (word frequencies, n-grams)

Semantic analysis (sentiment scoring)

Scalable processing for large text files

Modular NLP pipeline design

üõ† Features
Category	Techniques
Text Cleaning	Remove URLs, emails, HTML, digits, special characters, non-breaking spaces
Normalization	Case folding, lemmatization (preserves meaning better than stemming)
Tokenization	Word-level and sentence-level splitting
Analysis	Word frequency, bigrams/trigrams, VADER sentiment scoring
Optimization	Batch processing for memory efficiency

üìö NLP Concepts Explained
1. Text Preprocessing
Why? Raw text contains noise (URLs, typos) that hurts NLP model performance

Techniques:

Cleaning: Regex patterns for removing unwanted elements

Tokenization: Splitting text into words/sentences using nltk.word_tokenize

Lemmatization: Reducing words to base forms (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run") using WordNet

2. Stopword Removal
Removes common words (e.g., "the", "and") that add little semantic value

Uses NLTK's predefined stopword lists for 20+ languages

3. Sentiment Analysis
Uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning)

Outputs scores:

compound: Aggregated sentiment (-1 = negative, +1 = positive)

pos/neu/neg: Probability distribution

4. N-grams
Sequences of N words (e.g., bigrams: "New York")

Useful for detecting common phrases and context patterns
